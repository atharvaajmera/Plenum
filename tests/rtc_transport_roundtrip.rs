//! End-to-end integration test for `RtcTransport`: spins up the real
//! relay-server axum router in-process, then drives two real
//! `RtcTransport::connect_as_offerer` / `connect_as_answerer` sessions against
//! it over loopback, performing genuine WebRTC ICE/DTLS negotiation (no fake
//! SDP, unlike `relay-server/tests/ws_routing.rs`).
//!
//! This is inherently slower and more timing-sensitive than the rest of this
//! repo's synchronous transport tests (see `tests/transport_tcp.rs`), since
//! real ICE gathering and DTLS handshakes take real wall-clock time even on
//! 127.0.0.1.
